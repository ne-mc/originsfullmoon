I will make this description better, but for now, it's a pretty simple mod so it gets a pretty simple description...  
  
Every full moon in Minecraft (an eight day cycle), when the non-existent clock strikes midnight, all connected players will have their [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) origin randomized.  
  
This mod is (currently) just a datapack packaged as a mod for simple distribution and use. I will likely expand on it in the future, but for now, this is its one trick.  
  
If you're looking for other awesome ways to randomize your origins, I highly recommend you take a look at [Origins Randomiser](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins-randomiser). It has cool features that this doesn't for randomizing your origin when you die or sleep with configurable amounts of same. This mod does none of that. You get eight days to live with your origin; then you get a new one.  
  
Unless you want to sleep through it, that is...  
  
See, there's nothing stopping you from sleeping through your supposed transformation and waking up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in your old skin. I'm considering preventing that "exploit", but I'm honestly not sold yet. I wanted to make this mod so that I could "force" myself into new origins, but at the same time, I don't like the idea or removing that agency. /shrugemoji
  
For now, you can dodge the transform. Oh, and you'll know when to sleep if you want to avoid it. There are inner-monologue messages that go out to you a few times throughout the full moon's day.
