# WTF is Origins: Full Moon?  
Origins: Full Moon is a super-simple mod that randomizes every players' [Origins](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) origin at "midnight" on every Minecraft full moon. No frills, just an eight-day rolling origin randomization.

## What it _does_ do...  
- changes all logged in users' origins at midnight (`18000t`) every eight days (on the zeroth day, a.k.a. the full moon)
- warn users multiple times throughout the full moon's day that a change is coming so that they have time to prepare
- currently allows players (or the server) to skip the transformation by sleeping through the full moon; this is the most likely aspect of the mod to change

## What it _doesn't_ do...  
- get configured; this thing currently has no configurability at all
- "enforce" the randomization or play catch-up when a randomization was missed; users could simply log out to dodge the transformation if they wanted to
- randomize you on death or sleeping; [Origins Randomiser](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins-randomiser) is an awesome mod that does this for you so use it if you want these other forms of randomization
- add any new blocks, items, or resources of any kind

# F.U.Q.  
## Yeah, but _why_ though?  
When you have a ton of Origins mods installed and you really want to experience what Minecraft is like from all of those perspectives, it can be more than a little daunting to even decide who you _want_ to be in a given world. I found myself in this situation a lot, and when I went to make something like this, I found that [TheQuantumXenon](https://www.curseforge.com/members/thequantumxenon/) had just released (or maybe upgraded; not sure) something that did exactly what I wanted! Or so I thought.

The longer I used the death-rando feature, the easier it became to do what I typically try to do playing any game: not die. This made my experience of many origins mostly null and void. I tried the sleepy-mode after that, but then I found that I had artificially created an incentive to spawn phantoms. It felt like my control of the situation was the problem.

Then there was the gear-problem. This one was probably just the origins that I had installed, but some had a tendancy to not allow armor or armor above a certain weight. When I would get rando'd into these origins, my gear would evaporate.

Those two main problems were the catalyst for this mod. I wanted to be (gently) forced into a new origin just often enough that I felt I could get familiar with it, potentially exploit its strengths for a time, and jump into something else before the weaknesses really got to me, or before everything felt too cheesy.

## Will there be more to this thing?  
Maybe. I'm still undecided on the direction of transformation enforcement. I may make it play catch-up in the long run, not allow sleep on the full moon, or maybe something else entirely. For now though, I just want to see how it goes, and absorb any feedback that may be offered.

At some point, I will probably add some configurability to it, but that honestly depends on the combination of anyone but myself even using it, and whatever would make sense to be able to configure.

I may also add randomized additional inner-monologue (warning) messages at some point. I'll also see about localization if that's a thing that's wanted.

It's not as likely, but I may add new items or blocks if they mechanically make sense to assist with the principles that I'm building this mod around.

## Forge?  
Let's see if anyone other than me even wants this thing first. If the mod stays a datapack that's packaged as a mod, yeah, probably. If I do go more into the real modding of it, then probably not. I know I'm not going to have the time or energy to support `n` mods across multiple loaders, and this is just getting me into Minecraft modding again; `n` will likely be greater than `1` soon enough.
